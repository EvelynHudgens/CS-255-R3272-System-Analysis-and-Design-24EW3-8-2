## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by being able to actively listen to the user and interpreting non-technical language into a technical understanding. User stories make this process easier by allowing a place to organize requirements and list details you picked up in conversation or elsewhere.
## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by first getting a good understanding of the requirements and what the program needs to do. If development starts without this, the code may become unmaintainable. I hope to incorporate scrum meetings into my future work as they are a great process for team members to communicate.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development not only requries great technical skill, but you need to have the ability to communicate and listen.
